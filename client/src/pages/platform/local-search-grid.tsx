const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is a Local Search Grid?",
    answer: "A local search grid (also called a geo-grid rank tracker) shows how your business ranks on Google Maps across multiple geographic points around your location. Instead of checking your rank from one spot, it checks from a grid of points — giving you the full picture of your local visibility across your entire service area.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from regular rank tracking?",
    answer: "Regular rank tracking checks your position from a single location (usually the city center). But Google results change dramatically based on the searcher's location. A grid tracker checks from 9 to 49 different points around your venue, showing you exactly where you rank well and where you need improvement.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does this compare to BrightLocal or Whitespark?",
    answer: "BrightLocal charges $39-79/month and geo-grid scans consume credits — heavy users burn through their allowance fast. Whitespark charges $14-140/month for rank tracking, and their geo-grid product is sold separately starting at $10/month. Both have keyword limits that push you into higher tiers. With Resto, geo-grid tracking is built into every plan with simple pay-as-you-go credits at $10 for 5 scans — plus every new account gets a $5 starter credit. And you get a full booking system, AI phone answering, and website management that neither platform offers.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does Local Search Grid cost?",
    answer: "Local Search Grid is built into every Resto plan. Every new account gets a $5 starter credit, and additional scans are pay-as-you-go — $10 for 5 scans or $35 for 25 scans (save 30%). No monthly subscription fees for the tool itself, no tier upgrades needed.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many keywords can I track?",
    answer: "You can track up to 25 keywords per venue. This covers all the important searches — your cuisine type, 'near me' terms, occasion-based searches (birthday dinner, date night), and competitor brand names. Most venues find 15-20 keywords covers everything that matters.",
  },
  {
    question: "How often are rankings updated?",
    answer: "You can scan whenever you want — each scan uses 1 credit. Most venues scan weekly or after making changes to their Google Business Profile to measure impact. You'll always see the latest scan date and can compare against previous scans to track progress.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the grid work?",
    answer: "Every venue uses a 5x5 grid (25 scan points) per scan. You can adjust the distance between points — from 0.5 miles for dense urban neighborhoods to 5 miles for wider suburban coverage. Each point checks your Google Maps ranking at that exact location.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do the colors on the grid mean?",
    answer: "Green means you rank in positions #1-3 (the Google Maps 3-pack — the top spot customers see). Yellow means positions #4-7 (visible but not top). Orange means #8-12 (second page territory). Red means #13 or lower (unlikely to be found). The goal is to turn every dot green across your grid.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a Google Business Profile?",
    answer: "Yes — the grid tracks your ranking in Google Maps and local pack results, which requires a Google Business Profile. If you don't have one yet, we can help you set one up and optimize it as part of our Local Citations service.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I track multiple locations?",
    answer: "Yes. Each venue on your Resto account gets its own grid with up to 25 keywords. Multi-location brands can compare grid performance across all their venues to identify which locations need the most attention and where to focus marketing spend.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need SEO experience to use this?",
    answer: "Not at all. The color-coded grid makes results instantly understandable — green is good, red needs work. And because Resto is a fully managed platform, our team handles the technical SEO work for you. You just watch the dots turn green.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long before I see results?",
    answer: "Most venues start seeing improvements within 4-8 weeks of optimizing their Google Business Profile, building citations, and improving reviews. The grid gives you visual proof of progress — you'll literally see red and orange dots shift to yellow and green as your rankings climb.",
