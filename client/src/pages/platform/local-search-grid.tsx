const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is a Local Search Grid?",
    answer: "A local search grid (also called a geo-grid rank tracker) shows how a business ranks on Google Maps across multiple geographic points around its location. Instead of checking rank from one spot, it checks from a grid of points — giving the full picture of local visibility across the entire service area.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from regular rank tracking?",
    answer: "Regular rank tracking checks position from a single location (usually the city center). But Google results change dramatically based on the searcher's location. A grid tracker checks from 9 to 49 different points around the business, showing exactly where it ranks well and where improvement is needed.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does this compare to BrightLocal or Whitespark?",
    answer: "BrightLocal charges $39-79/month and geo-grid scans consume credits — heavy users burn through their allowance fast. Whitespark charges $14-140/month for rank tracking, and their geo-grid product is sold separately starting at $10/month. Both have keyword limits that push you into higher tiers. With IndexFlow, geo-grid tracking is built into every plan with simple pay-as-you-go credits at $10 for 5 scans — plus every new account gets a $5 starter credit. And you get a full content engine, CRM, AI widget, and SEO tools that neither platform offers.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does Local Search Grid cost?",
    answer: "Local Search Grid is built into every IndexFlow plan. Every new account gets a $5 starter credit, and additional scans are pay-as-you-go — $10 for 5 scans or $35 for 25 scans (save 30%). No monthly subscription fees for the tool itself, no tier upgrades needed.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many keywords can I track?",
    answer: "You can track up to 25 keywords per workspace. This covers all the important searches — service types, 'near me' terms, industry-specific searches, and competitor brand names. Most businesses find 15-20 keywords covers everything that matters.",
  },
  {
    question: "How often are rankings updated?",
    answer: "Automated weekly scans keep data fresh. You can also scan on-demand at any time — each scan uses 1 credit. Compare current results against previous scans to track progress over time.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the grid work?",
    answer: "Every workspace uses a 5x5 grid (25 scan points) per scan. You can adjust the distance between points — from 0.5 miles for dense urban neighborhoods to 5 miles for wider suburban coverage. Each point checks the Google Maps ranking at that exact location.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do the colors on the grid mean?",
    answer: "Green means positions #1-3 (the Google Maps 3-pack — the top spot customers see). Yellow means positions #4-7 (visible but not top). Orange means #8-12 (second page territory). Red means #13 or lower (unlikely to be found). The goal is to turn every dot green across the grid.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a Google Business Profile?",
    answer: "Yes — the grid tracks rankings in Google Maps and local pack results, which requires a Google Business Profile. If the client doesn't have one yet, it can be set up and optimized as part of the onboarding process.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I track multiple locations?",
    answer: "Yes. Each workspace gets its own grid with up to 25 keywords. Multi-location brands can compare grid performance across all their workspaces to identify which locations need the most attention and where to focus marketing spend.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need SEO experience to use this?",
    answer: "Not at all. The color-coded grid makes results instantly understandable — green is good, red needs work. The visual reports are client-ready and easy to share without any SEO expertise.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long before I see results?",
    answer: "Most businesses start seeing improvements within 4-8 weeks of optimizing their Google Business Profile, building citations, and improving reviews. The grid gives visual proof of progress — red and orange dots shift to yellow and green as rankings climb.",
