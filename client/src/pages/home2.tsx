const faqItemsCol1 = [
  { q: "What's the same across all plans?", a: "Every plan includes 40 AI posts per workspace per month, Rank Tracker (1,000 keywords), Local Search Grid (5x5), Google Search Console, full CRM, all 5 CMS integrations, Link Builder, Post Validator, On-Page Auditor, Site Profiler, Schema Markup, AI Widget, Twilio, domain mapping, invoicing, Link Health monitoring, BYOK, and multi-language support." },
  { q: "Can I buy additional workspaces?", a: "Yes. On the Professional plan, you can purchase additional workspaces up to 50 total. White Label supports up to 150. Enterprise is unlimited." },
  { q: "How do Rank Tracker credits work?", a: "Every workspace gets 1 free keyword refresh per calendar week, auto-applied every Monday. Need instant refreshes? Buy credits: 5 for $10 or 25 for $35." },
  { q: "How does the Local Search Grid work?", a: "Each workspace gets 1 free weekly 5x5 grid scan, auto-applied. Buy instant scan credits: 5 for $10 or 25 for $35. The grid maps your client's Google Maps ranking across 25 geographic points — the clearest way to show local SEO progress and one of the most compelling things to include in a monthly report." },
  { q: "What does white label include?", a: "Upload your logo, set your brand name, pick brand colors, configure a custom domain, and set your support email. Your clients see your brand everywhere — IndexFlow branding is completely hidden across all dashboards, reports, emails, and URLs." },
  { q: "What is BYOK?", a: "Bring Your Own Key. Connect your own API keys for AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, Grok, Mistral, Cohere, Perplexity), image banks (Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay), payment processors (Stripe, PayPal), and Twilio. All keys encrypted with AES-256-GCM. Your keys, your costs, your control." },
  { q: "Is there annual pricing?", a: "Yes. Pay annually and get 2 months free (pay for 10, get 12). Solo drops to $83/mo, Professional to $249/mo, and White Label to $416/mo. The easiest way to reduce your costs without changing anything else." },
  { q: "Can I cancel anytime?", a: "Yes. No contracts, no lock-in. Cancel your subscription at any time. We believe the product should earn your renewal every month — not trap it." },
  { q: "Do I need to move my existing website or content?", a: "No. IndexFlow is a delivery and optimisation layer — not a website builder. Your content stays exactly where it is. We connect to it, optimise it, and make sure Google finds it. No migration, no downtime, no rebuilding anything from scratch." },
  { q: "Does it work with GoHighLevel?", a: "Yes. IndexFlow works alongside GHL, not against it. If your clients are on GHL, IndexFlow connects to their domains and handles the SEO layer that GHL consistently fails to deliver — indexing, rank tracking, on-page audits, and reporting. You keep GHL for what it does okay. You use IndexFlow for what it does brilliantly." },
  { q: "What CMS platforms does it publish to?", a: "WordPress, Shopify, Webflow, Ghost, and Wix. One-click publishing with automatic formatting, image alt text, and schema markup. No copy-paste, no reformatting, no broken layouts." },
  { q: "What happens after the $1 trial?", a: "After 30 days you choose the plan that fits — Solo at $99, Pro at $199, or Agency at $349. No automatic charges at a higher rate, no surprise fees. If you decide it's not for you, cancel before day 30 and you pay nothing more. We'd rather earn your business than trap it." },
  { q: "Is the white label actually white label?", a: "Completely. Your logo, your domain, your colour scheme, your brand name. Clients log into what looks like your platform. IndexFlow is invisible to them — it never appears in URLs, emails, reports, or dashboards. You own the client relationship 100%." },
  { q: "What is a workspace?", a: "A workspace is an isolated client environment — their own dashboard, their own content, their own rank tracking, their own reports. Each workspace is completely separate from the others. On Pro you get 50 workspaces, meaning you can manage up to 50 clients from one login under your brand." },
  { q: "Can I charge my clients more than I pay for IndexFlow?", a: "That's exactly the point. At $199/month for 50 workspaces, each workspace costs you $3.99. Most agencies charge $99–$299/month per client for SEO tooling. Two clients at $100/month and you've broken even. The remaining 48 workspaces are pure margin. IndexFlow is designed to be a profit centre, not a cost." },
  { q: "How does the $1 trial work exactly?", a: "Pay $1 today and get full access to the Pro tier for 30 days — all 40+ tools, all 50 white label workspaces, full white label branding. No feature restrictions, no watermarks, no sandbox mode. The real thing from day one so you can set up client workspaces and see the value immediately." },
  { q: "What does GSC Ingestion Layer mean?", a: "It means IndexFlow automatically pulls all your clients' Google Search Console data into one unified dashboard. Impressions, clicks, indexing status, crawl errors — all properties, all in one place. No logging into 10 different GSC accounts. No exporting CSVs. Everything consolidated and ready to report on." },
  { q: "Is IndexFlow SOC 2 compliant?", a: "Yes. IndexFlow runs on SOC 2 compliant infrastructure with data isolation per tenant, encryption at rest and in transit, and Cloudflare edge security across all deployments. Enterprise clients regularly ask about this — the answer is yes, documented, and available on request." },
  { q: "Can I use IndexFlow as a solo freelancer?", a: "The Solo plan at $99/month is built exactly for you — one workspace, one domain, all 40+ tools. You get the same rank tracker, content engine, on-page auditor, and reporting suite that agencies use, at a price that makes sense for a single operator. When you land your first client, upgrade to Pro." },
  { q: "How many keywords can I track?", a: "1,000 keywords per workspace, tracked weekly. That's significantly more generous than Ahrefs Lite (750 total) or Semrush Starter, both of which cost more than IndexFlow Solo on their own — before you count the 39 other tools you're not paying for separately." },
  { q: "Can I run audits across all client domains at once?", a: "Yes. The SEO Health Dashboard gives you a cross-workspace overview so you can spot which clients have critical issues without logging into each workspace individually. From there you can drill into any domain for a full site crawl, broken link report, redirect chain analysis, and Core Web Vitals breakdown." },
  { q: "What's the difference between Post Validator and On-Page Auditor?", a: "Post Validator scores individual pieces of content before or after publishing — checking keyword density, readability, meta tags, internal links, and schema on a per-post basis. On-Page Auditor runs a broader site-level crawl, identifying issues across all pages at once. Use Post Validator when creating or editing content. Use On-Page Auditor to find what needs fixing across an entire domain." },
];

const faqItemsCol2 = [
  { q: "How many keywords can I track?", a: "1,000 keywords per workspace, tracked weekly. That's significantly more generous than Ahrefs Lite (750 total) or Semrush Starter, both of which cost more than IndexFlow Solo on their own — before you count the 39 other tools you're not paying for separately." },
  { q: "What's the difference between Pro and Agency?", a: "Scale and team size. Pro gives you 3 users and 50 workspaces — ideal for a solo operator or small team managing up to 50 clients. Agency gives you 6 users and 100 workspaces with advanced API access, a dedicated account manager, and priority onboarding — built for teams running serious volume." },
  { q: "Do my clients need their own IndexFlow account?", a: "No. You manage everything from your single login. Each client gets access to their own white-labelled workspace — which looks like your platform to them. They never create an IndexFlow account, never see IndexFlow branding, and never know what infrastructure is running underneath." },
  { q: "How long does it take to set up a client workspace?", a: "Most workspaces are live in under 10 minutes. Connect the domain, configure white label branding, connect Google Search Console, and you're ready to run audits, track keywords, and generate content. The setup guide walks you through every step. No guesswork." },
  { q: "Do I need technical skills or a developer?", a: "No. IndexFlow is built for agency owners and freelancers, not developers. The Cloudflare and GitHub pipeline runs automatically in the background — you never touch code. If you can use a dashboard, you can run IndexFlow. The only exception is Enterprise custom integrations, which may involve developer configuration." },
  { q: "Is there an onboarding guide or setup wizard?", a: "Yes. Every account includes a built-in Setup Guide that walks you through connecting your first domain, configuring white label branding, linking Google Search Console, setting up your rank tracker, and generating your first content batch. Pro and Agency plans also get a priority onboarding call with the team." },
  { q: "Can I import existing content or keywords?", a: "Yes. You can import keyword lists directly into the Rank Tracker via CSV — up to 1,000 keywords per workspace. Existing content on connected CMS platforms is automatically detected and available for auditing, optimisation, and internal link building from day one." },
  { q: "What AI models power the content engine?", a: "IndexFlow supports multiple AI providers via BYOK — OpenAI (GPT-4o), Anthropic (Claude), Google AI, Grok, Mistral, Cohere, and Perplexity. Connect your own API key for whichever provider you prefer. No lock-in to a single model — use the one that suits your content quality and cost requirements." },
  { q: "Can I set a brand voice or tone for each client?", a: "Yes. Each workspace supports its own AI training via the Knowledge Base — upload brand guidelines, tone of voice documents, example content, or industry-specific context. The AI uses this to generate content that sounds like your client, not like a generic language model." },
  { q: "What are quality gates and how do they work?", a: "Quality gates are automatic checks that run on every piece of AI-generated content before it's published. They verify minimum word count, keyword inclusion, readability score, meta title and description presence, image alt text, and schema markup. Content that doesn't pass is flagged for review rather than published automatically. It's the difference between bulk content and bulk quality content." },
  { q: "Can I use my own HTML templates for content?", a: "Yes. Import your own HTML design and use it as the template for programmatic content generation — your layout, your styling, your structure. IndexFlow populates it with AI-generated, SEO-optimised content at scale. Perfect for service area pages, location pages, and product descriptions." },
  { q: "Does it generate images automatically?", a: "Yes. Connect your image bank via BYOK — Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay — and IndexFlow automatically selects and inserts contextually relevant images into generated content. Alt text is written automatically based on image context and keyword targeting. No manual image sourcing, no missing alt tags." },
  { q: "What does Enterprise include?", a: "Unlimited workspaces, unlimited domains, custom API integrations, dedicated infrastructure, Super Admin dashboard, named account manager, SLA guarantees, custom contracts, and co-marketing options. Pricing starts around $1,200/month on annual contracts." },
  { q: "Can team members have different permission levels?", a: "Yes. You control what each team member can see and do across workspaces. Assign roles so staff can manage their own client accounts without accessing others. The Agency plan supports 6 users, Enterprise is unlimited with full Super Admin controls." },
  { q: "Can I manage different clients without them seeing each other's data?", a: "Completely. Every client lives in their own isolated workspace — separate content, separate rankings, separate CRM, separate reports. There is zero crossover between workspaces. One client can never see, access, or be affected by another." },
  { q: "What reporting can I send to clients automatically?", a: "You can schedule automated branded reports covering rank tracking, local search grid results, on-page SEO health, indexing status, content performance, and GSC data. Reports go out under your brand on your schedule — weekly, monthly, or on demand. Clients get a polished PDF that looks like you spent hours on it. You didn't." },
  { q: "Can clients log into their own IndexFlow dashboard?", a: "No — and that's intentional. Only you control the IndexFlow workspace. If you're deploying programmatic content via IndexFlow's LLM engine, you manage what gets published. If your client's domain is on WordPress, Shopify, Wix, or another CMS, they already have back-end access to their own website as normal — IndexFlow just handles the SEO delivery layer on top of it." },
  { q: "How fast does Google index content published through IndexFlow?", a: "Typically within hours, not weeks. IndexFlow includes Google Indexing Automation that submits new and updated pages directly to Google's indexing API on publish. Most platforms leave pages to be discovered by Googlebot on its own schedule — which can take weeks. IndexFlow skips the queue." },
